# Ant-Colony---Java

Object oriented programming project, done in Java.
Given a heavy graph the goal is to find the lowest cost cycle that passes through all nodes of the graph only once, through Ant Colony Optimization (ants are simulated, and they randomly cross the graph and upon finding a cycle add pheromones to that path, which later on will be decreased, over the time)

The wide variety of algorithms, whether for optimization or other difficult problems, that seek self-organization in biological systems has led to the concept of swarm intelligence, which is often a structure in which ant colony algorithms fit together.

Final grade: 6.8/7
